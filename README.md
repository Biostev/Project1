# Features
- You can enter your formula and see info about this element or chemical. If the formula is not in db, you can add it

# Interface
There is an input field in the MainWindow. Enter your chemical formula there. Then the InfoWindow will appear.
InfoWindow has a table and 2 buttons: Update data and Delete. You can change info in the table, but some rows are read-only (Formula for both and checical also has a read-only molecular mass). After changing you can click Update data button and the database will be updated with it. Also you can delete element/chemical from the database by clicking Delete button.
'All elements list' button in the main window will open window with all allowed elements as buttons. The element can be deleted by clicking on it. The last two buttons are '+' and 'reset to default'. The first can add new element to the list. It must be a string started with a capital letter. The second button resets the elements list to default condition (All elements in 2023).
